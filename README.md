# Project Title
The Great Resignation: Labor Statistics & Employment Findings for Industries & Workers Most Affected and Associated Causes

## Project Description
  The Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS for short, is responsible for providing labor statistics and employment findings based on financial, social, legal and economic events. The data is used to determine changes to the labor market, such as quit rates, hire rates and job openings by factors such as region/state, sector/industry, gender and income status. 
  
  We've provided three interactive visualizations in our dashboard to show the following data:  
  
  **Visualizations**
  - Quit, Hire and Job Opening Rates From 2001 - 2023: Line Chart 
  - Annual Quit Rates for Top 5 Industries During Covid-19: Bar Chart
  - Total Quit Rates by Industry During and After Recession: Bar Chart 
  
This interative dashboard explores the ["Bureau of Labor Statictics" dataset](https://www.bls.gov/). This dashboard contains charts to visualize BLS data that will allows us to better understand labor trends caused by major events such as the Covid-19 pendemic and the 2008 recession.
